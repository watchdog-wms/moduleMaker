#### INSTALLATION  
##### Manually:

  - Download a release from https://github.com/watchdog-wms/moduleMaker/releases
  - Extract and rename the **distribute/** folder to **moduleMaker/** and move it into the 
  Watchdog installation folder (e.g. /path/to/watchdog/moduleMaker/).
  
##### Automatically:
Alternatively, you can run **helper_scripts/downloadModuleMaker.sh** located in
  the Watchdog installation directory to download and install it automatically.

#### RUN MODULE MAKER

The distributed jar files are build for Java 11 and are launched internally 
by a Bash script. In order to start the moduleMaker, change into the 
**moduleMaker/** directory and call

./moduleMaker.sh

The moduleMaker depends on the JavaFX SDK. The Bash script will try 
to identify the install location of the JavaFX SDK automatically.

#### BUILD
1) adapt **buildModuleMaker.ant.xml**
2) set JAVA_HOME to java11 using `export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jre-11-openjdk/`
3) run `ant -f buildModuleMaker.ant.xml`
